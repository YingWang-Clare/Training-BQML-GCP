# Training-BQML-GCP
Predict Visitor Purchases with a Classification Model with BigQuery ML on Google Cloud Platform

This is a learning project of Coursera Course: Google Cloud Platform Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals.

## About BQML
BigQuery Machine Learning is a new feature in BigQuery where data analysts can create, train, evaluate, and predict with machine learning models with minimal coding.

## Process
1. Create a BigQuery dataset to store models
2. Create and select a BQML model type and specify options:

```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model`
OPTIONS
(
model_type='logistic_reg',
labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']
)
AS

#standardSQL
SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430') # train on first 9 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid) # visitors who bought on a return visit (could have bought on first as well 
  USING (fullVisitorId)
;
```

![](pics/image10.png, "Model Details 2")

![Training process details:](pics/image4.png)

3. Evaluate classification model performance:

    Select your performance criteria: Our goal is to minimize the False Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they don't) and maximize the True Positive Rate (predict that the user will return and purchase and they do).
    
    This relationship is visualized with a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve like the one shown here, where you try to maximize the area under the curve or AUC.
    
    Evaluate how well the model performs with this query using `ML.EVALUATE`:
    
```SQL
SELECT
  roc_auc,
  CASE
    WHEN roc_auc > .9 THEN 'good'
    WHEN roc_auc > .8 THEN 'fair'
    WHEN roc_auc > .7 THEN 'not great'
  ELSE 'poor' END AS model_quality
FROM
  ML.EVALUATE(MODEL ecommerce.classification_model,  (

SELECT
  * EXCEPT(fullVisitorId)
FROM

  # features
  (SELECT
    fullVisitorId,
    IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
    IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  WHERE
    totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20170501' AND '20170630') # eval on 2 months
  JOIN
  (SELECT
    fullvisitorid,
    IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM
      `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid)
  USING (fullVisitorId)

));
```

4. Improve model performance with Feature Engineering:
    There are many more features in the dataset that may help the model better understand the relationship between a visitor's first session and the likelihood that they will purchase on a subsequent visit.

    Add some new features and create a second machine learning model called `classification_model_2`:

    * How far the visitor got in the checkout process on their first visit
    
    * Where the visitor came from (traffic source: organic search, referring site etc..)
    
    * Device category (mobile, tablet, desktop)
    
    * Geographic information (country)
```SQL
CREATE OR REPLACE MODEL `ecommerce.classification_model_2`
OPTIONS
  (model_type='logistic_reg', labels = ['will_buy_on_return_visit']) AS

WITH all_visitor_stats AS (
SELECT
  fullvisitorid,
  IF(COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0 AND totals.newVisits IS NULL) > 0, 1, 0) AS will_buy_on_return_visit
  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`
  GROUP BY fullvisitorid
)

# add in new features
SELECT * EXCEPT(unique_session_id) FROM (

  SELECT
      CONCAT(fullvisitorid, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS unique_session_id,

      # labels
      will_buy_on_return_visit,

      MAX(CAST(h.eCommerceAction.action_type AS INT64)) AS latest_ecommerce_progress,

      # behavior on the site
      IFNULL(totals.bounces, 0) AS bounces,
      IFNULL(totals.timeOnSite, 0) AS time_on_site,
      totals.pageviews,

      # where the visitor came from
      trafficSource.source,
      trafficSource.medium,
      channelGrouping,

      # mobile or desktop
      device.deviceCategory,

      # geographic
      IFNULL(geoNetwork.country, "") AS country

  FROM `data-to-insights.ecommerce.web_analytics`,
     UNNEST(hits) AS h

    JOIN all_visitor_stats USING(fullvisitorid)

  WHERE 1=1
    # only predict for new visits
    AND totals.newVisits = 1
    AND date BETWEEN '20160801' AND '20170430' # train 9 months

  GROUP BY
  unique_session_id,
  will_buy_on_return_visit,
  bounces,
  time_on_site,
  totals.pageviews,
  trafficSource.source,
  trafficSource.medium,
  channelGrouping,
  device.deviceCategory,
  country
);
```
